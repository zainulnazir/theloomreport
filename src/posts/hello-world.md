## Welcome to the loom

Every morning we spin up a fresh digest of AI breakthroughs, venture activity, policy updates, and adoption learnings. Drafts begin life in an agent workflow, but publishing always routes through editorial review.

## What to expect

- **Signal over noise** – We surface research that meaningfully shifts how builders and buyers operate.
- **Strategic framing** – Each story comes with a take on why it matters and who should care.
- **Verification loop** – Automated moderation plus human review keeps content aligned with our standards.

Stay tuned for daily reports and the weekly digest that ties the threads together.
