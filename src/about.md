## Our mission

TheLoomReport threads the signal from the noise across the AI stack—model releases, tooling shifts, policy moves, and real-world adoption. Every article blends automated research with human editorial judgment before publication.

## How it works

1. **Signal harvesting** – Our agents monitor research archives, funding announcements, product updates, and policy briefings.
2. **Automated synthesis** – We use carefully crafted prompts to assemble structured drafts with transparent sourcing.
3. **Human review** – Editors moderate tone, verify links, and add context before anything ships.

## Editorial standards

* We cite primary sources and highlight uncertainty.
* We keep affiliate and sponsorship disclosures explicit.
* We prioritize accessibility and reader privacy.
